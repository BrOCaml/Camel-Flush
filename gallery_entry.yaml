  Our project is a Texas-Holdem, but with a camel twist. It is player vs computer, 
  where the computer plays for 7 different players. The user player always plays 
  first each round, there are four rounds. The interace is simple but offers 
  enough information about the community cards, pot, player's cards and chips. 
  Each round, each player can fold, call, raise or check. 

  Note that our implementation is slightly different than the actual game, our 
  game is over after four rounds. At which point if there are still players in 
  the game, the winner is announced with their respective earnings, and if there 
  are no players left, there is no winner. 

  Each player starts with 100 chips (camel chips) and the winner is the player 
  with the highest hand after the fourth round. Here are the three stages of 
  dealing the community cards:
  - the flop: the first three community cards.
  - the turn: the fourth community card.
  - the river: the fifth and final community card.

  Your mission is to construct a five-card poker hand using the best available 
  five cards out of the seven total cards (your two hole cards and the five 
  community cards). 

  PLEASE BE AWARE: the computer players are (not) very smart, so play at 
  your own risk.  

  Have Fun!
