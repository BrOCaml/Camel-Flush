  Our project is an Texas-Holdem, but with a camel twist. It is player vs computer, 
  where the player can set the difficulty level of the game out of {easy, medium, hard}. 
  Each level corresponds to the advantage level the computer has over the player, 
  where level hard indicates the computer is very likely to win. The interace is 
  simple but offers enough information about the player's hand and the table cards 
  {the flop, the turn, the river}. 
  the flop: the first three community cards.
  the turn: the fourth community card.
  the river: the fifth and final community card.

  Each player starts with the same set amount of "bet" (could be cool to 
  call them "Camel-Coins") and 2 arbitrary cards, the 'hole cards. During each round, 
  the player can "fold", "call", "raise" or "all-in." Over the game, five more cards are 
  (eventually) dealt and shown to the players. Each player is free to use these cards 
  in combination with their cards to build a five-card poker hand. 

  Your mission is to construct your five-card poker hands using the best available 
  five cards out of the seven total cards (your two hole cards and the five community 
  cards). 

  After each game, the player is congratulated!
